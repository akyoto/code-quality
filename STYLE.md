# Code Style

This document is only meant to teach you the code style used among each project and will not attempt to explain *why* this coding style is used.

* [Tabs vs Spaces](#tabs-vs-spaces)
* [Empty line between blocks and statements](#empty-line-between-blocks-and-statements)
* [Empty line between commented blocks](#empty-line-between-commented-blocks)
* [Variable names](#variable-names)

* [Don't comment out outdated code](#dont-comment-out-outdated-code)
* [Comments start with space and uppercase](#comments-start-with-space-and-uppercase)
* [Package names](#package-names)
* [Use goimports](#use-goimports)

## Tabs vs Spaces

Use [tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment](https://eduardurbach.com/post/tabs-vs-spaces):

```go
type Translation struct {
	English   string
	Japanese  string
	Korean    string
	French    string
}
```

## Empty line between blocks and statements

Bad:

```go
func() {
	if true {
		// Block 1
	}
	if true {
		// Block 2
	}
	doSomething()
	doSomething()
	if true {
		// Block 3
	}
}
```

Good:

```go
func() {
	if true {
		// Block 1
	}

	if true {
		// Block 2
	}

	doSomething()
	doSomething()

	if true {
		// Block 3
	}
}
```

## Empty line between commented blocks

A commented block is a sequence of lines preceded by a descriptive comment. Commented blocks should be treated as normal blocks and therefore require newlines separating them from other blocks.

Bad:

```go
func(a int, b int) int {
	// Add one to a and b
	a++
	b++
	// Calculate c as the sum of a and b
	c = a + b
	// Return c squared
	return c * c
}
```

Good:

```go
func(a int, b int) int {
	// Add one to a and b
	a++
	b++

	// Calculate c as the sum of a and b
	c = a + b

	// Return c squared
	return c * c
}
```

## Variable names

Variables are written in `camelCase` and should clearly state what they contain, preferably with no abbreviations. Common short names like `id` and `url` are allowed.

Iterator variables in loops are an exception to this rule and can be 1-letter, non-significant variable names, usually `i` and `j`. `index` is also quite common.

## Early returns

Do not wrap a whole function in 1 if-block to check parameters. Use early returns.

Bad:

```go
func DoSomething(a string, b string) {
	if a != "" && b != "" {
		doIt(a, b)
	}
}
```

Good:

```go
func DoSomething(a string, b string) {
	if a == "" || b == "" {
		return
	}

	doIt(a, b)
}
```

## Types at the top

`type` definitions should be placed at the very top of your files. Variables, constants, interface implementation assertions and the `package` statement are the only constructs allowed above `type` definitions.

## Private fields at the end of a struct

This is not an absolute rule but try to keep private fields at the end of a struct.

```go
type MyType struct {
	PublicA string
	PublicB string
	PublicC string

	privateA int
}
```

## Don't comment out outdated code

You should delete outdated code instead of commenting it out. Comments should be used for explanation of existing code and outdated code is saved in the git history anyway if you ever need it (in most cases outdated code is never re-used).

## Comments start with space and uppercase

Example:

```go
// This comment starts with a space and an uppercase letter.
```

## Package names

Package names should be short lowercase identifiers and tests should be written using the black box pattern. Black box testing can be enabled by adding the suffix `_test` to the package names in `*_test.go` files. It will enable you to test your library like it would be used by another developer, without internal access to private variables.

## Use goimports

Your IDE should automatically call `goimports` to format your code and add/re-order import statements every time you save the file.
